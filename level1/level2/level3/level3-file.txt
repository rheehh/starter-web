While officials did not give much information about Rahami, CNN, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that Rahami traveled multiple times to Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years, including a year-long stay in Pakistan until March 2014. Police were looking into whether he was radicalized overseas, CNN said.
